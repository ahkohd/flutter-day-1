# Yeah, My First Flutter App
Hmm, a friend of mine told me how awesome flutter was. He kept hammering this, then I said to myself I should try it out. I went on to download the SDK and set things up. I followed the [First layout tutorial](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/ui/layout/tutorial) and kept checking the [Docs](https://flutter.dev/docs/reference/widgets) when I encountered an error. Boom after some few hours I was able to come up with this.
