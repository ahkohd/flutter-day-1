# Yeah, My First Flutter App
Hmm, a friend of mine told me how awesome flutter was. He kept hammering this, then I said to myself I should try it out, so I went ahead to download the SDK and set things up. I followed the (First layout tutorial)[https://flutter.dev/docs/development/ui/layout/tutorial] and kept checking the (Docs)[https://flutter.dev/docs/reference/widgets] when I encountered an error. Boom after some few hours I was able to come up with this.
